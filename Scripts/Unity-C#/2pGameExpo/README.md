# 2 Player Game Scripts
Scripts from my 2D 2 player arena shooter I created for my capstone project and to submit to UW-Whitewater's MAGD Expo 2018.

Note: Player2's scripts were almost the same as Player1's

p#Controller was used as the base for player movement shooting and other player related functions. 

p#StatsCal was used to setup each players stats.

projMovmentP# was uses to controll how the bullets/projectiles moved and behaved in the game.
