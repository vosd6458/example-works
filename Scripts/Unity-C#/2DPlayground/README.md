# 2DPlayground
Various scripts that I played around with testing different C# functions and how I could use them to interact with various 2d objects.

playerMovement is a basic movement script allowing the player to move with the arrow keys

ObjectClicker lets the player click on specific objects defined by a tag to do different functions. You can click on a "ncp" to turn them a different color and for a short period display the objects name in text at the top of the screen. 
If the npc has been clicked you can right click on the player to reset the npc's color.
